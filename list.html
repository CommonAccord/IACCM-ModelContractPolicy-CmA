<center><font color="red">DRAFT - HYPOTHETICAL -  FOR DISCUSSION ONLY</font><br><b>IACCM PROPOSED FORM OF CONTRACT STYLE POLICY</b></center><br><br>

The policy is intended to be used by a company with its business partners and its suppliers, including its law department and outside lawyers. <br><br>

The policy takes a defensive perspective;  it addresses the situation where company is receiving contract text from the partner or supplier.  The policy acts as a quality control filter for incoming materials.<br><br>

The defensive posture leaves open the possibility that the other party will have good reasons to propose to do things differently. Those proposals may have merit and improve or expand the contract solutions. <br><br>

It also highlights the extent to which standards are needed to avoid confusion, risk and needless work.  Enterprises are rightly concerned with being infected by inappropriate or malicious contract terms.  Forms and style rules reduce their exposure and increase their ability to focus on the important parts of the business relationship.<br><br>

There are three goals: <ol><li>the policy makes it easier for the company to understand and review legal materials, <li>the policy encourages partners of the company to use good, consistent practices in contract text and negotiations, <li>the policy facilitates collaboration and standards work, including that of the IACCM.</ol>The "policy" itself is a document standard.  It uses the modular formats and versioning that it recommends.
